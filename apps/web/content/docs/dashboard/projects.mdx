# Projects

Projects contain memories and are scoped to an organization.

## Creating a Project

1. Navigate to your organization dashboard
2. Click **New project**
3. Enter a name and slug
4. The slug is used in MCP config as `MEMCTL_PROJECT`

## Project Limits

The number of projects you can create depends on your plan:

| Plan | Projects |
|---|---|
| Free | 2 |
| Lite | 5 |
| Pro | 20 |
| Business | 50 |
| Scale | 200 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

## Project Settings

Admins and owners can:

- Update project name and description
- Delete projects (this permanently removes all memories)
