# Organizations

Organizations are the top-level entity in mem/ctl. All projects, members, and billing are scoped to an organization.

## Creating an Organization

Organizations are created during onboarding or via the API. Each organization has:

- **Name** — Display name
- **Slug** — URL-safe identifier, used in MCP config as `MEMCTL_ORG`
- **Plan** — Determines limits (projects, members, memories, API calls)

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Owner | Full control, billing, delete org |
| Admin | Manage projects, members, tokens |
| Member | View projects, use MCP tools |

## Business Details

For tax-deductible purchases, organizations can optionally provide:

- Company name
- VAT/Tax ID
- Billing address

These are included on Stripe invoices for accounting purposes.
