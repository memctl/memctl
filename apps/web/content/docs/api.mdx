# REST API

mem/ctl provides a REST API at `https://memctl.com/api/v1` for direct HTTP access to memories, organizations, projects, and tokens.

Most users interact with mem/ctl through the MCP tools (via their AI agent) or the CLI. The REST API is for custom integrations, scripting, and dashboard functionality.

## Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer mctl_your_token_here
```

Generate tokens in your dashboard under **Settings → API Tokens**. Use `npx memctl auth` to store a token locally for CLI and MCP server use.

Organization and project context is passed via headers:

```
X-Org-Slug: your-org
X-Project-Slug: your-project
```
