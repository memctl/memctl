# Authentication

The mem/ctl API supports two authentication methods.

## API Tokens

Generate API tokens in your organization's **Tokens** page. Use them as Bearer tokens:

```
Authorization: Bearer mctl_your_token_here
```

API tokens are long-lived and suitable for MCP server configuration.

## JWT (Session-based)

For the dashboard and web-based tools:

1. Sign in via GitHub OAuth
2. A session cookie is set
3. Generate a short-lived JWT via `POST /api/v1/auth/token`

```bash
curl -X POST https://memctl.com/api/v1/auth/token \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orgId": "your-org-id"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbG..."
}
```

JWTs expire after 1 hour. Session validity is cached for 5 minutes.
