# Self-Hosting

mem/ctl is open source (Apache-2.0) and can be self-hosted.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- A Turso database (or any libSQL-compatible database)
- GitHub OAuth app (for authentication)
- Stripe account (for billing, optional)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memctl/memctl.git
cd memctl
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Set Up Database

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

### 4. Build & Start

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### 5. Configure MCP Server

Point your MCP server to your self-hosted instance:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "MEMCTL_API_URL": "https://your-instance.com/api/v1"
  }
}
```

## Docker (Coming Soon)

A `docker-compose.yml` for simplified self-hosting is planned.
