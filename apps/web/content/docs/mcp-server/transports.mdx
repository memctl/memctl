# Transports

## stdio (default)

The default and recommended transport. The MCP server runs as a local process launched by your agent.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memctl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memctl@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MEMCTL_ORG": "your-org",
        "MEMCTL_PROJECT": "your-project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After running `memctl auth`, no token is needed in the config. The CLI reads it from `~/.memctl/config.json`.

For CI or shared environments where `memctl auth` isn't available, add `MEMCTL_TOKEN` to the env block.

## Streamable HTTP (planned)

Cloud-hosted mode using Streamable HTTP transport. This will allow connecting to mem/ctl without running a local process.

Planned for a future release.
