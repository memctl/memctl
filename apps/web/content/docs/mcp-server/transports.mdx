# Transports

## stdio (Default)

The default transport. Used when running via `npx memctl` or as a local process. This is the recommended transport for most use cases.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memctl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["memctl"],
      "env": {
        "MEMCTL_TOKEN": "your-token",
        "MEMCTL_ORG": "your-org",
        "MEMCTL_PROJECT": "your-project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Streamable HTTP (Future)

Cloud-hosted mode using Streamable HTTP transport. This will allow connecting to mem/ctl without running a local process.

This transport is planned for a future release.
