# MCP Tools

mem/ctl exposes memory CRUD tools plus structured agent-context tools that can replace static `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` guidance.

## Memory tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `memory_store` | Store a key-value memory (upsert by key) |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve a memory by key |
| `memory_search` | Search memories by key/content |
| `memory_list` | List memories with pagination |
| `memory_delete` | Delete a memory by key |
| `memory_update` | Update content and/or metadata |
| `memory_capacity` | Return memory usage, plan limit, and full/available status |

## Agent functionality tools

These tools provide typed, queryable project guidance for AI agents:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `coding_style` | Naming, formatting, review rules |
| `folder_structure` | Repository layout and domain boundaries |
| `file_map` | Where to find key files/features |
| `architecture` | System design and module responsibilities |
| `workflow` | Branch/PR/deploy process |
| `testing` | Test expectations and locations |
| `branch_plan` | What to implement on a branch |
| `constraints` | Hard limits and non-goals |

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `agent_functionality_list` | List available types and saved items, with memory status and current branch |
| `agent_functionality_get` | Get detailed items for a type, or one specific item |
| `agent_functionality_set` | Create/update structured functionality data |
| `agent_functionality_delete` | Delete a structured functionality item |
| `branch_context_get` | Get branch metadata and branch plan memory |
| `branch_context_set` | Save what should be implemented on a branch |
| `branch_context_delete` | Delete a branch plan memory |

## Memory full behavior

When plan memory capacity is full:

- `memory_store`, `agent_functionality_set`, and `branch_context_set` will return an error.
- The error message tells the agent to delete unused memories first.
- Use `memory_capacity` to check current usage and limit.
