description: mem/ctl — shared, persistent memory for AI coding agents
---

# mem/ctl

**mem/ctl** is a cloud MCP server that gives AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) shared, persistent memory scoped to projects and organizations.

## Why mem/ctl?

AI coding agents lose context between sessions. They forget decisions, patterns, and project-specific knowledge. **mem/ctl** solves this by providing a shared memory layer that persists across sessions, machines, and IDEs.

## Key Features

- **Shared Memory** — Store project context, decisions, and patterns that every agent on your team can access
- **Cross-IDE** — Works with any MCP-compatible client: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more
- **Team Sync** — Organization-scoped projects with role-based access control
- **Open Source** — Apache-2.0 licensed. Self-host or use our cloud

## How It Works

1. Install the MCP server: `npx memctl`
2. Configure your AI coding agent with your project credentials
3. Your agent can now store and retrieve memories via MCP tools
4. All team members share the same project memories
