# mem/ctl

**mem/ctl** is a cloud MCP server that gives AI coding agents persistent memory across sessions. Your agent remembers coding conventions, architecture decisions, lessons learned, and project context - stored server-side and available from any machine.

## The problem

AI agents lose context between sessions. Every new conversation starts from zero - your agent forgets your team's coding style, past decisions, and hard-won lessons.

## How mem/ctl solves it

1. **Authenticate once** - run `npx memctl auth` to store your API token locally
2. **Add to your MCP config** - just org and project, no token in project files
3. **Your agent remembers** - context persists across sessions, machines, and IDEs

## What you get

- **11 MCP tools** with 90+ actions for memory management, context assembly, session tracking, branching, and more
- **9 built-in context types** - coding style, architecture, testing, constraints, lessons learned, workflow, folder structure, file map, branch plans
- **Cross-IDE** - works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, Zed, JetBrains, Amazon Q
- **Team sync** - organization-scoped projects with role-based access
- **Offline mode** - local SQLite cache with automatic sync
- **Open source** - Apache-2.0. Self-host or use the cloud
