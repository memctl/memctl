# AGENTS.md

Copy this into your repository root as `AGENTS.md`. This works with any MCP-compatible agent (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Cline, etc.).

## memctl MCP Rules

MCP server name is `memctl`.
Use `memctl` for all project memory:
- memory/history of previous sessions
- coding style and conventions
- architecture and technical decisions
- testing rules and constraints
- branch plans and handoff notes

Do not keep important project context only in chat.
Always store decisions, conventions, and lessons learned in memctl so they persist.

## Session Start (always)

1. `context.bootstrap` - load all project context
2. `session.start` with `autoExtractGit=true` - register this session
3. `activity.memo_read` - check for notes from the last session
4. `branch.get` - load the current branch plan if one exists

If the project has not been scanned yet (or file map is stale), run:
- `repo.scan` with `saveAsContext=true`

## Before Coding

Read relevant context:
- `context.functionality_get` for: `coding_style`, `architecture`, `testing`, `constraints`, `workflow`
- `context.context_for` for files you are about to touch
- `branch.get` for current branch plan and checklist

## While Coding

When user gives new conventions or decisions, store immediately:
- `context.functionality_set` for structured project rules (coding style, architecture, testing, etc.)
- `memory.store` for one-off decisions, references, or notes

For memory/history search:
- `memory.search` - search by content
- `memory.list` - browse by priority or recency

After each meaningful task, save branch progress:
- `branch.set` with updated `status`, checklist items (`done: true/false`), and short notes

## End Of Session

1. Save final branch progress with `branch.set`
2. Leave handoff note (`activity.memo_leave`) if anything is pending or unfinished
3. End session with summary (`session.end`) including what was done and what keys were modified

## Do Not

- Do not store secrets, tokens, passwords, or API keys in memctl
- Do not store large file contents or binary data
- Do not skip `context.bootstrap` at the start of a session
- Do not keep important decisions only in chat without storing them
- Do not create duplicate memories - search first with `memory.search`
- Do not ignore memos from previous sessions

## Context Types

- `coding_style` - naming, formatting, linting rules
- `architecture` - system design, modules, tech stack
- `testing` - framework, conventions, coverage rules
- `constraints` - hard limits, non-goals, security rules
- `workflow` - branch strategy, PR process, CI/CD
- `lessons_learned` - past mistakes, gotchas
- `folder_structure` - repo layout
- `file_map` - key files per feature
- `branch_plan` - current branch implementation plan
```

## Importing and exporting

You can also generate this file from your stored context:

```bash
# Export stored context as AGENTS.md
npx memctl export agents_md > AGENTS.md

# Import an existing AGENTS.md into memctl
npx memctl import AGENTS.md

# Export as .cursorrules for Cursor
npx memctl export cursorrules > .cursorrules
```

Or via MCP tools:

```
import_export.export_agents_md   - generate AGENTS.md from stored context
import_export.agents_md_import   - parse and import AGENTS.md content (supports dryRun)
import_export.cursorrules_import - parse and import .cursorrules content
```
